- [Canvas](https://lwtech.instructure.com/courses/2579040)

    - The notes are written in markdown so you have the option of enhancing them with your own inlined notes.
- Resources
  - [Java Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se23/html/index.html)
    - When in doubt, read the spec
  - [Teams meeting](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_ZGE4OGFjZjMtNzE3NC00Nzc3LWE3NzctNjk2YWY0ZWZiZjQz%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%226ac90cf0-4613-4fa5-a2b5-89248502d821%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22aca7f456-ce3b-404b-95ed-0d27d0266e04%22%7d)
    - You are expected to attend class in-person. The teams meeting is set up to facilitate recording, and to accomodate special circumstances.
  - IDE
    - You're welcome to use any IDE of your choice for coding in this class.
    - If you're not particular about one, it'll be convenient for you to use what I use: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Here are some extensions I find useful:
        - Extension Pack for Java
        - GitHub Markdown Preview
        - GitHub Pull Requests
        - Excalidraw
        - Live Share
        - vscode-code-review
  - GitHub
    - Although not required for this class, I highly encourage you to get started on GitHub with a free student account: https://github.com/education/students.
